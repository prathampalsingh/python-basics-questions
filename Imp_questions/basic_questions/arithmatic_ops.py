# The provided code stub reads two integers from STDIN, a and b. Add code to print three lines where:

# The first line contains the sum of the two numbers.
# The second line contains the difference of the two numbers (first - second).
# The third line contains the product of the two numbers.

# Sample Input 
# 3
# 2

# Sample Output
# 5
# 1
# 6


a = int(input())
b = int(input())
print("output :")
print(a+b)
    # print(abs(a-b))
print(a-b)
print(a*b)
